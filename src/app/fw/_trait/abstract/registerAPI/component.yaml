desc: "Communication between controller and view on direct method calls is enabled by this trait.
       It allows the controller to 'call' markup resolvings that are under concern of the view.
       Delegating this task to the view using model fields or events would have been to heavy weighted.
       The controller created the view and is therefor allowed to communicate with its view directly.
       Using a register/call to achieve the markup resolving is the best way.
       This trait gives the views a 'registerAPI' method that only allows 'markup' registrations"
